<b>Titanic Survival Exploration</b>

Algorithm: Manual implementation of Decision Trees

Created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's
features, such as sex and age with 80% accuracy.

<b>Finding Donors for CharityML</b>

Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Ensemble, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines

Data Set: Census Income Data Set - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income

Employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census.
Along with other features, this can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not
they should reach out to begin with.

<b>Train a Smartcab to Drive</b>

Algorithm: Q-Learning

Constructed an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that navigates a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal. Since the
Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent is evaluated on two very important
metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its destination while running red lights or narrowly
avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in
time would be considered unreliable.

<b>Identifying dog breeds</b>

Algorithm: OpenCV, Convolutional Neural Networks: ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception and Xception

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identified an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code
identifies the resembling dog breed. Used transfer learning on several CNN architectures, finally picking one which yielded 84%
accuracy.

<b>Creating Customer Segments</b>

Algorithm: Decision Tree Regression, PCA and K-Means Clustering

Data Set: Wholesale customers Data Set - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers

Analyzed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories for internal
structure. Described the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with, equipping
the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

<b>Capstone - Diagnosing Cardiomegaly from X-rays</b>

Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning from ImageNet trained models

Data Set: NIH Chest X-rays - https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community

Using own CNN model and several ImageNet trained models like InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG19 and Xception, binary classified a
chest X-ray to determine if the patient is suffering from cardiomegaly.

Using transfer learning on VGG19, was able to achieve a F1-score of 0.9553
