Project Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree!

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic
disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its
complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This
project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

In addition, you'll make sure Python is installed with the necessary packages to complete this project. There are two Python
libraries, numpy and pandas, that we'll use a bit here in this project. Don't worry about how these libraries work for now —
we'll get to them in more detail in later projects. This project will also familiarize you with the submission process for the
projects that you will be completing as part of the Nanodegree program.
